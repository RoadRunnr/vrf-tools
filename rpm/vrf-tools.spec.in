%description
This package provides a library and some command line utilities
to work with Linux network namespaces and mend them into "VRFs".

A VRF in this context is a "Virtual Routing and Forwarding"
instance, compromising a full separate internet router (incl.
host). The functionality available is determined by the kernel
version, but Linux kernel support is fairly exhausting.

Use with kernels older than 2.6.36 is not recommended due to
various kernel bugs.

Features tested and used by the author include:
 - routing, including policy routing
 - various netlink protocols
 - netfilter, including conntrack & NAT
 - VLANs
 - TUN/TAP devices
 - ppp devices

Features tested and found non-working by the author:
 - traffic shaping (tc / qdiscs / classifiers / etc.)
   (this was on a 2.6.38 kernel and might be fixed by now)
